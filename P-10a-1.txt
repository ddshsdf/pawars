problem statement:Sniff Wi-Fi hot spots and analyse wireless network strength using
InSSIDer

Lab Objectives:
 1. Install and configure InSSIDer
 2. Check the wireless signal strength

Lab Environment:
 1. Windows OS
 2. Web browser with Internet connection
 3. Administrative preveleges

Lab Tasks:

1. Type http://inssider.en.softonic.com/download in the address bar of a web browser, and press enter, as shown in figure

2. in the webpage that opens, click on the link, download InSSIDer for windows, as shown in figure

FIGURE----

3. Click on free download, as shown in figure

FIGURE--

4. Click on the downloaded files,as shown in figure

FIGURE---

5. In the next screen that appears, click on next, as shown in figure

7. in the next screen that appears, click on next, as shown in figure

FIGURE----

8. Then the following screen will appear, as shown in figure

FIGURE----

9. Then after the files gets installed,the following screen will appear, as showm in figure 8 click ok

FIGURE---

Then InSSDer icon will appear on the desktop, as shwon in figure

FIGURE---

10. Double click on the InSSDer icon on the desktop,
Then the following screen will appear, as shown in figure 10

FIGURE----

11. Click on the Time Graph tab, as shiwn in figure

FIGURE---

it will show the time graph of all the availabel SSID, we need to elect the particularSSID
what we need to know


12. Click on the particular SSID as shown in figure 12, In this lab we have selected WSTREAM AP0 SSID

FIGURE----

Now you have to select another SSID for comparison

13. Scroll down the SSID and select WStream AP -1, as shon in figure

FIGURE----

14. Then the following screen will appear, as shown in figure

15. Click on the 2.4 GHz channels tab, as shiwn in figure

FIGURE-----


16. it will show 2.4Ghz channels for two SSID, WStreamAP1 and WStreamAP0 

17. Click on 5Ghz channel, as shown in figure

Then the following screen will appear as shown in figure

FIGURE--------

Thus, you can see the signal strenght for both the SSIDs.
In this way, we can analyse wireless network strenght wit the help of SSIDer tool
